Scenario: Ranking employees based on their sales performance. Question: Given a table with employee information and their sales figures,
how would you rank the employees based on their sales performance using window functions?

CREATE TABLE Employees (
  EmployeeID INT,
  EmployeeName VARCHAR(50),
  SalesAmount DECIMAL(10,2)
);

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, EmployeeName, SalesAmount)
VALUES (1, 'John', 5000.00),
       (2, 'Jane', 7000.00),
       (3, 'David', 4000.00),
       (4, 'Emily', 9000.00),
       (5, 'Michael', 6000.00);



       Query:

SELECT *,RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SalesAmount desc) as SalesRank
FROM Employees

EmployeeID	EmployeeName	SalesAmount	SalesRank
4	            Emily	          9000.00	  1
2	            Jane	          7000.00	  2
5	            Michael	        6000.00	  3
1	            John	          5000.00	  4
