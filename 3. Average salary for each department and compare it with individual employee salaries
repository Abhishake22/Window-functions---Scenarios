Scenario: Calculating the average salary for each department and comparing it with individual employee salaries. 
Question: How would you calculate the average salary for each department and also display each employee's salary alongside the department average using window functions?


CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT,
  department_id INT,
  employee_name VARCHAR(100),
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, department_id, employee_name, salary)
VALUES
  (1, 1, 'John Smith', 5000.00),
  (2, 1, 'Jane Doe', 6000.00),
  (3, 2, 'Michael Johnson', 7000.00),
  (4, 2, 'Emily Davis', 5500.00),
  (5, 3, 'David Wilson', 8000.00),
  (6, 3, 'Jessica Brown', 7500.00);


SELECT *,AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS Department_Average_salary
FROM employees
