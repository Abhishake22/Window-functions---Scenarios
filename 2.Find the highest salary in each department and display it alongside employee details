Scenario: Finding the highest salary in each department and displaying it alongside employee information. 
Question: How would you use window functions to find the highest salary in each department and display it alongside employee details?


CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT,
  department_id INT,
  employee_name VARCHAR(100),
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, department_id, employee_name, salary)
VALUES
  (1, 1, 'John Smith', 5000.00),
  (2, 1, 'Jane Doe', 6000.00),
  (3, 2, 'Michael Johnson', 7000.00),
  (4, 2, 'Emily Davis', 5500.00),
  (5, 3, 'David Wilson', 8000.00),
  (6, 3, 'Jessica Brown', 7500.00);



  Query:


  WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT*,RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id order by salary desc) AS highest_salary
  FROM employees)
  SELECT * from CTE
  WHERE highest_salary = 1


  Output:

  employee_id	department_id	employee_name	salary	highest_salary
2	              1	            Jane Doe	6000.00	1
3	              2	            Michael Johnson	7000.00	1
5	              3	            David Wilson	8000.00	1
